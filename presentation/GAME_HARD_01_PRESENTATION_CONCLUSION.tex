\begin{itemize}
\item Results indicate a major performance boost using WARP, when compared to that of the reference device driver
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Accounting for roughly three orders of magnitude
  \end{itemize}
\item However, important to keep in mind that the drivers may be useful for different purposes
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This calls into question what the flaws of using WARP, in place of the reference device driver, may be
  \end{itemize}
